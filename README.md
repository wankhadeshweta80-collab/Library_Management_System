# Library_Management_System
📚 Library Management System (LMS)
This project is a single-page, client-side application designed to simulate the core functions of a small library management system. It focuses on inventory tracking, issue/return management, and automated fine calculation.

📌 Description
The Library Management System provides a clean, responsive interface for managing book inventory. It allows a user (acting as a librarian) to add books, update their status to "Issued" or "Returned," and automatically calculates overdue fines based on the due date.

The system is built as a highly portable, single HTML file, combining structure, styling, and JavaScript logic for a seamless experience.

🔧 Technologies Used
Technology

Purpose

HTML5

Structure and Semantic Markup.

Tailwind CSS

Utility-first styling for a modern, fully responsive UI.

Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

Core logic for data manipulation, fine calculation, and DOM updates.

localStorage

Client-side persistence for saving book records.

📄 Core Features
Book Inventory Management: Easily add and permanently remove books from the library list.

Issue/Return Tracking: Toggle the book status between 'Available' and 'Issued' with a single click.

Automated Fine Calculation: Automatically calculates overdue fees (₹1.00 per day) based on the current date and the 7-day issue period.

Overdue Visual Alert: Overdue books are highlighted with a pulsing red status badge for immediate visibility.

Real-Time Search: Instantly filter the book list by Title or Author as you type.

Marquee Notice: A prominent, scrolling notice at the top informs users about the fine policy.

🚀 How to Use
Download: Save the index.html file to your computer.

Open: Open the index.html file directly in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

Manage: Start adding books, issuing them, and observing the fine calculations in the table.

📁 Project Structure
This project uses a single-file architecture for maximum portability:

simple-register-form/
└── **index.html** # Contains all HTML, Tailwind CSS configuration, and JavaScript logic.
└── **README.md** # This documentation file.

🔒 Note on Data
The current version of the application uses the browser's localStorage for data persistence. This means data is saved only in your current browser and is not shared across devices or other users.

For a production-ready solution, the next step would be integrating a cloud database like Firebase Firestore.
